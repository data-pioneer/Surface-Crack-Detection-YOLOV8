# Surface Crack Detection using YOLOv8 and Roboflow

This project implements YOLOv8 for surface crack detection in various materials like concrete, asphalt, and metal. It utilizes a custom dataset downloaded from Roboflow, allowing you to train and deploy a crack detection model tailored to your specific needs.

## Key Features:

##### YOLOv8 for real-time detection: Leverages the accuracy and speed of YOLOv8 for efficient crack identification in images and videos.
Custom Roboflow dataset: Train your model on a dataset specifically curated for surface crack detection, improving accuracy and generalizability.
Easy training and deployment: Provides Python scripts for training, evaluation, and inference, making it accessible to users with varying technical expertise.
##### Visualization and analysis: Includes tools for visualizing detected cracks and analyzing results to gain insights into crack patterns and severity.

## Getting Started:

##### Clone the repository: Download the project code from GitHub.
##### Install dependencies: Install the necessary Python libraries given at the top of ipynb files.
##### Download the Roboflow dataset: Use the provided Roboflow link or API key to download the custom crack detection dataset.
the desired script is provided in Roboflow_crack_model_download.ipynb file.
##### Train the model: Run the crack_detector_Computer_Vision_Project.ipynb script to train the YOLOv8 model on your downloaded dataset.
##### Evaluate the model: after running the scirpt given in above file, yolo video interface will opened with segmentation of detected cracks on surface.
